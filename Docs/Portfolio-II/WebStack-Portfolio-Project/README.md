# GO!

Yes it’s time to white-board, to code, to troubleshoot bugs, to re-code, to solve other bugs, to refactor, etc..

Development is not a long quiet river, but it can be really fun!

Starting today, you are building **YOUR** project - be proud of it!

# Evaluation - Show off!

After the pitch, now you will code - nice right? but don’t forget you will present it at the end (the Peer Learning Day following this project) in front of professionals and staff.

Have fun!

## Tasks

### 0. The presentation

You will present your project individually or as a team on a zoom call.

Your presentation, inclusive of the demo, should not exceed 16 minutes. You are expected to provide the following:

- A public GitHub repository for your project.
- A Google Slides presentation including:
    - A brief description of the project and your team.
    - A breakdown of the architecture and the technologies or third-party services used.
    - A report of your developments, highlighting your successes, challenges, areas for improvement, lessons learned, and next steps for your project.
    - A conclusion summarizing your experience.

**Remember, the presentation is a vital part of your project completion, so be sure to include it in your planning to avoid any delays in submission.**

### 1. Video Demo of your project

Alongside your project presentation, we require a short video demo, no longer than 3 minutes, that showcases the essential features of your project, illustrating how they all work together. This could take the form of a user walkthrough.

We’ve created a tutorial video to inspire you with our expectations. Think of it as an inspirational tool, **not a strict template**, designed to help you effectively showcase your brilliant work. Your creativity and individual touch will make your demo even more engaging.

A few points to consider while preparing your video:

- **Maximum Video Duration:** The video should not exceed **3 minutes**, ensuring it is concise and engaging.

- **Background Music:** If you include background music, ensure it’s **copyright-free** to avoid potential legal issues.

- **Voice-Overs:** Feel free to use your voice to guide us through your project. Ensure your voice is clear, audible, and not overshadowed by the background music.

- **Recommended Tools:** We suggest using

    - **Recording:** Zoom(record + screenshare), Loom, Camtasia, etc
    - **Editing tools** such as: Filmora Wondershare, Camtasia for your video creation.
    - **How to share:** YouTube (or, if blocked in your country, use a similar site), or a cloud storage service (G-drive, One-drive, etc). Submit the URL of your video. **Make sure your video is accessible to the public** - On YouTube, it’s fine to flag it as **“unlisted,”** but don’t flag it as **“private”**

**Please note that your project will not be considered complete without this video submission. It forms an integral part of your final project assessment.**

So, let’s see your creativity in action.

We are eagerly awaiting your presentations and demo videos.

Happy building,

### 2. Good use of Version Control

You must demonstrate a good understanding of version control through effective use in your portfolio project. This include:

- Committing as often as possible
- using descriptive and professional commit messages
- collaboration through the use of branches and pull requests

### 3. Quality of presentation and project

The complexity, quality and curiosity that you put in your project is important - go beyond your limit and surprise us!
