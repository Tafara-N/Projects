Web Stack Portfolio Project Criteria
Portfolio Project Idea Bank
Portfolio Project Idea Bank
Portfolio project
Last run!
Yes! the portfolio project of the Webstack specialization will be your last-major-project!

Make your choice
You will have almost 2 weeks to develop your portfolio project - during this period you will be alone or by team - to create a fully functional web application.

Be before starting any coding, you will need to research and define the project.

This project is important:

Because it will end your pathway at ALX
It’s summarize the entire Back-end specialization
The weight of this project is important in your overall score
You can be as creative as you want
And the most important: You should be proud of it - it will be THE project to show off during interview
Solo or by team?
Good question right?

The first question you should ask yourself is: what I want to do?

Front-end app? Mobile app? Back-end app? API service? e-commerce website? cloud platform for videos streaming? or better: a learning platform?

Don’t be afraid to work in a team - “more resources” means bigger project - but also more soft-skills.

Working solo is also fine - just don’t think too big or find quick-win to achieve your project.

No idea?
Be creative doesn’t mean “create a web application that will make the world a better place” - no - it means: do what you really want: it can be applying concept your learn during the curriculum - it can be exploring a new technology (Go, Rails, etc.) - or make a clone of an existing platform (I was not joking about the learning platform or video streaming…)

Try to solve a problem or learn!

Also, a web application doesn’t only mean “Website”, it can also be just an API.

Steps of this portfolio project
To end the curriculum, the portfolio project is split in 3 parts:

The pitch (this project)

## Tasks

### 0. Pitch me your idea!

As mentioned in the beginning of this project, you have some questions to ask yourself:

- 👨‍💻 Solo or team 👩‍💻 👨‍💻 👩‍💻 👨‍💻?
- What do I want to build?
- How do I want to build it?
- Is it possible to build it in less than 2 weeks?
- Do I like what I’m doing?

When you know these answers, you will have to prepare a pitch:

- Max 10min of pitch (please repeat to not go over)
- Google slide presentation with:
    - Name of the project
    - List of team members
    - Description of the project
    - Learning objectives
    - Technologies used
    - Third services used if applicable
    - Challenges already identified
    - Schedule of work (by using [Trello](https://trello.com/en) or [Kanban board](https://kanbanflow.com/) or other) - don’t forget that you have less then 4 weeks (27 days exactly)
    - Mock-ups if applicable
- Video Recording of one or more team members presenting the pitch (using the Google Slide presentation)

Please post your slides and the recording to your web-stack portfolio pitch here.

Let’s do it! 💪
