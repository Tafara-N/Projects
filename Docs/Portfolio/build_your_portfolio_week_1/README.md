## And now, we build!

This week is all about execution! You have a detailed plan and you’ve thought through many aspects of your project. Now, get to work and try to hit the goals you’ve set for yourself or your team. The deliverable for the upcoming week will be a status report to share the challenges and progress you’ve encountered this week.

# PLD: Portfolio Project Checkin

During the PLD this week, these are the objectives:

- Each team meets with 3 other teams, one at a time for 40 minutes.
- During the team-team meeting, each team presents for 20 minutes, then observes for 20 minutes.
- When a team is presenting, they share their proposal, problem statement, and walk through code any they’ve implemented and technical choices they have made.
- When a team is observing, they ask questions, share observations, and code review.

## Some things to think about

**Front-load the biggest challenges first**

This is the best time to tackle the areas you defined as the riskiest parts, and prioritizing them so that you can be confident that the project is feasible end-to-end. By taking this on first, it also allows for time to update your plan and rework your solution if necessary.

**Organize the collaboration**

If you’re working as a team, clarify the integration points, schedule and expectations. Frequent checkins, and co-locating to work in-person can be very effective.

**Implement specified branch strategy; merge often**

Merging code frequently is a great way to avoid a broken application the night before the presentation.
