# The Presentation

You’ve done so much! You’ve come so far. The day to present your portfolio project is nearly here.

The presentation will consist of several parts:

- A slidedeck made with Google Slides
- Introduction of team members, and each person’s role
- Story of how your project was inspired
- Technology & Architecture
- Core algorithms and code snippet
- Discussion of process, collaboration and timeline
- Challenge(s) overcome
- Live Demo
- Learnings about technical interests as a result of this project
- Time to answer questions from the audience
- Feedback and comments provided by technical staff, possibly alum guests

The length of time for a presentation will be 18 minutes

You will have 2 minutes setup, 8 minutes to present followed by 8 min Q&A.

Presentations take practice. The mid-week PLD will give you that opportunity! Come prepared to practice.

## Great Presentations

It might be helpful to take a look at [this playlist of Ted talks about giving great presentations](https://www.ted.com/playlists/574/how_to_make_a_great_presentation).

Here are some great speakers to observe and pattern your speaking after:

- [Steve Jobs at Stanford Commencement 2005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i9kcBHX2Nw)
- [Sheryl Sandberg: Take the Lead Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U-CRqK8M1c)
- [Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture: Achieving your childhood dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo)

What do these speakers have in common? Why are their presentations effective?

## Tasks

### 0. Share a link to your Google Slides

### 1. Presentation Content

The presentation covers:

- Introduction of team members, and each person’s role (1pt)
- Story of how your project was inspired (1pt)
- Technology & Architecture (5pt)
- Core algorithms and code snippet (5pt)
- Discussion of process, collaboration and timeline (2pt)
- Challenge(s) overcome (5pt)
- Learnings about technical interests as a result of this project (1 pt)

### 2. Presentation Delivery

Whether you are presenting onsite or remotely, here are the things we look for when you are presenting.

Please note, if you are presenting remotely, you will need to have your webcam on while your group is presenting.

- Were the Presenters audible?
- Did the Presenters speak clearly and at an understandable pace?
- Were there minimal filler words, like “Uhm”, “uhh”, “like”?
- Were the Presenters well-positioned on stage/in the camera’s view?
- Did the Presenters’ postures demonstrate confidence?
- Were the Presenters dressed professionally?
- Did the presentation utilize the time allotted? (it was not too long, or too short)
- Were the Presenters energetic?
- Did the Presenters engage the audience with a question?

### 3. Live Demo

For teams who are working on web apps, a live demo means that the presentation must load the deployed website during the presentation and demonstrate at least one of the key features.

For teams who are not working on a web application, please prepare a video of the application being used. This includes the Maze project.

Not all parts of the application need to be demonstrated. As an example, if a project required uploading a file and waiting for 30m to process the data, it is enough to show that the file can be uploaded and that there is output generated from a previous run that is representative of the eventual output.

Scoring will be as follows: 5/5 points for a functional, engaging demo 3/5 points for a simple demo 0/5 points for a demo that meets unworkable errors or failures


### 4. Answering audience questions

This is a great list of guidelines for how to answer questions during a presentation: [Witt.com](http://wittcom.com/how-to-handle-questions-and-answers-qa-made-simple/)

If the Presenters receive questions from the audience, they are answered in a satisfactory way, or there is an offer to followup with an answer.
