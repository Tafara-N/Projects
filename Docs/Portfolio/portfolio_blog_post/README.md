![Portfolio Project Blog Post](blog_post.gif)

You’ve done it! You’re on the other side of your final project. There’s just a few finishing touches before we complete the year.

For this project, write a blog post about your portfolio project to capture all the trials and learnings you’ve encountered along the way. Everything you struggled with, and everything you’ve accomplished needs to be written down now before you forget! Capturing these details make a world of difference when it comes time to present your project to employers. Especially if you choose to continue with a Specialization for Year 2, it will be imperative that you can easily recall the details of this project and explain them expertly.

If you’ve done the work planning and researching along the way, you’ll have a lot more material to draw from. Feel free to refer back to the plans you created for yourself, and reflect upon whether those may be interesting to share. Also feel free to include images, screenshots, or text from the proposals.

# Requirements:
- Share your blog post at least on Twitter and LinkedIn
- Each person must write their own post, even if you worked in a team.
- The blog post must be done and published before the first deadline.
- Must be written in English

# Some examples:
- [How I designed and launched the official Scrabble keyboard](https://hackernoon.com/follow-your-dreams-literally-how-i-designed-and-launched-the-official-scrabble-keyboard-d1ce3ab0f047)
- [Announcing SweetAlert](https://medium.com/@edwards/announcing-sweetalert-2-0-eebd2f66bac2)
- [Mistakes I made writing a Django App (and how I fixed them)](https://hackernoon.com/mistakes-i-made-writing-a-django-app-and-how-i-fixed-them-16de4e632042)

## Tasks

### 0. Share your blog post

Please include your LinkedIn link and the source post.

### 1. Introduction

Introduce your project with a few key elements:

- Include a banner image on your post that is a screenshot (or a logo) of your application
- Define the purpose of your project
- Share your team members, roles and timeline
- Describe who your project was created for
- Explain what your personal focus was

Example: Our project helps bicyclists find a route with the least elevation between two points in San Francisco. Our team members are John Smith, Jane Doe, and myself. As an engineering problem, we wanted to focus on 2 things: creating an experience that would be both web and mobile-friendly, and also sourcing a reliable and sophisticated API. John worked on [XYZ], Jane and I worked on [ABC].

### 2. Tell a story about yourself which relates to why you chose to work on this project

This is not simply a sentence to describe an affinity for something and therefore, you made this project. This story needs to share something personal about yourself that people can’t easily know about you by looking at your Twitter.

Here’s an example of a story that is too simple:

*Everyone on our team really likes riding bicycles, so we thought it would be cool to do a project focused on bicycling.*

This is a better example of a story:

*Everyone on our team enjoys riding bicycles, so it was an easy project focus to agree upon. For me, bicycling has always been the best way to get around. In past jobs I’ve had, I’ve been able to commute by bicycle so that I could get my workout in before and after work.*

This is an example of a story that will really captivate your audience:

*Everyone on our team enjoys riding bicycles, so it was an easy project focus to agree upon. For me, I grew up in a small middle-of-America town surrounded by farms and forests. My best friend lived in the next town over, and the only way I could visit her was by riding my bicycle. On weekends, and holiday breaks I would get up at the break of dawn and bike for over an hour to my friend’s place. The road I took was lined by corn fields on both sides with the sun rising on the left. Whenever I bike in the city now, it brings back these hours I spent chasing the brightening horizon at dawn with the smell of the harvest around me. I hope to make bicycling more accessible so that more people, especially city people, can learn the joy that bicycling can bring to their lives.*

A question I often hear is: “But I don’t have a story. I just thought [X] was cool so I thought I would do a project about it. What do I write?”

Here’s a couples examples of what you might write if this was the case:

*Oddly enough, I don’t really have any interest in bicyling, even though my project is all about bicycle routes. I had decided very early on that I wanted to work with the Google Maps API, and needed a reason to use it. A few weeks ago I had lunch with an engineering friend of mine to brainstorm project ideas and he described a problem he faces every day: He enjoys riding his bicycle to work, but still hasn’t quite found the optimal path from home to work, and work to home with the least uphill. I learned this about myself– it’s a lot more interesting to work on something when I’m directly helping someone solve a problem they have. For the entirety of this project, I’ve been working closely with him to iterate and find him an easy path to and from his home!*

It’s okay if the story just isn’t there. Find another way to share something about yourself.

*My team really cared about bicycling, so I went along with it because I thought it was an interesting technical challenge. To celebrate completing our project, we rented bicycles and went for a ride around the city. I moved to this city from a small middle-of-America town surrounded by farms and forests 9 months ago. I had been out of work for 2 years ever since they shut down the button factory and laid off 350 workers. My entire career had been spent as the mechanic monitoring the hydrolic systems at this factory for the past 5 years. I have two daughters and a wife who supported me in this transition across the country to take a bet on my potential to retrain as a Software Engineer. I never would have guessed that 9 months later I would be riding a bike across the Golden Gate Bridge with 2 amazing engineers I’ve met through my time at Holberton School.*

### 3. Summarize what you've accomplished with your project

Describe the result of your project.

- Include a diagram of the architecture that clearly shows the flow of data through your application. If the one you created for the proposal is still accurate, use it. Otherwise create a new one that reflects the actual flow of data.
- Summarize the technologies you used and why you (or your team) made those choices. Do not list the technologies without context. For example, do not write “We used HTML, JS, Python, Django”. Instead, include the context like “For the Frontend we chose to use HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript without any additional frameworks. We opted not to use other frameworks because we wanted to dedicate our time to solidifying our understanding of JavaScript.”
- Provide an overview of 1-3 features you’ve completed. Here’s some examples of what is and isn’t a feature:
	- Feature: OAuth via Facebook. It is functionality that has value for the user.
	- Not a feature: The entire application is styled with Bootstrap. There is no functionality mentioned here.
	- Feature: The website is responsive and compatible with mobile. This means users can access the project from a mobile view!
	- Not a feature: The project does not have a backend. This does not have value for the end-user.

### 4. Write about your most difficult technical challenge in depth

Describe the most difficult technical challenge that you **succeeded in solving** using the [STAR method](https://outage.vccs.edu/). If you are not familiar with the STAR method, it is an acronym that stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result.

Do not explicitly reference the STAR method, but write at least 200 words (the more detailed, the better), on the technical challenge you felt was the most difficult for you.

It’s okay if the challenge was solved with an interim workaround. Choose a different challenge if the issue still remains.

Example to avoid: *“I built a login page hoping this would allow for users to save their own profile and bicycle routes. I spent too much time and couldn’t get it working, so currently users cannot save their routes, but I’ll fix it soon.”*

Good example: *“Early in the project I had decided to provide a save feature for users so that they could return to the app and review their cycling routes. I set out to research the different types of login options and decided to go with Facebook OAuth because it was the network I would likely be able to grow my audience through. To implement Facebook OAuth, I realized my project needed to be deployed and secured through SSL. With only 30 hours left for my project, I reached out to 5 of my peers and the technical staff to rally through deployment and set up an SSL cert in 6 hours. I followed this tutorial [url] and ran into an issue where the auth request would successfully send, but it seemed the login token would never be received. A diagram to understand the issue might help here: [diagram] I reached out again to Facebook’s developer forums and found an engineer who was willing to meet in-person in exchange for a cup of coffee. She looked at my diagram and clarified that the request I sent was missing a parameter, and the other parameter I sent signaled to the server I didn’t need a response. With only 5 hours before my presentation, I managed to get the Facebook OAuth working and managed to even shower before the presentation!”*

*note: all examples are works of fiction and do not reflect technical accuracy*

### 5. Share what you've learned

Again, favor verbosity. Suggestions for what to write about here:

- Technical take-aways
- What you might do differently
- What you learned about yourself as an engineer
- How this project informs your engineering path in the future
- Confirm or question any beliefs you held prior to this project (e.g. “Actually, emacs is a really powerful editor and I can understand why it is preferable to vim.”)

### 6. Add a short paragraph about yourself after the concluding paragraph

- Describe yourself in a few sentences
- Link to the GitHub link for the project
- Link to the deployed project page
- Link to the project’s landing page
- Link to your LinkedIn profile
